# KAROL SKOLASI≈ÉSKI
## Junior Java Developer
My programming adventure began in 2019. During the intensive course at Software Development Academy I learned a solid foundation of Java and object-oriented programming. Since then programming has become one of my biggest passions. I constantly develop my skills and knowledge by participating in on-line courses and creating my own projects. It is the issues related to the Spring framework that are particularly interesting to me.
